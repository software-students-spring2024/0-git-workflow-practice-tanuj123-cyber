# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).

[Here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/10/1075764/building-a-world-class-platform-for-software-engineers/) is a link to a an article about JPMorgan building a new interface for their software engineers, written by MIT Technology Review Insights. The article details how the company dedicated a project towards building a helpful interface/platform for software engineers working there to make their workflow much faster and more efficient. This project was pursued after it was discovered that a large number of software developers within the company were suffering from consistent burnout and consequently inefficient work due to inefficient processes. I find it quite interesting because it details a time where the company actually improves company infrastructre and processes for the engineers, rather than replacing the workers or hiring more in order to distribute more labor.
