# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).

[Here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/10/1075764/building-a-world-class-platform-for-software-engineers/) is a link to a an article about JPMorgan building a new interface for their software engineers, written by MIT Technology Review Insights. The article details how the company dedicated a project towards building a helpful interface/platform for software engineers working there to make their workflow much faster and more efficient. This project was pursued after it was discovered that a large number of software developers within the company were suffering from consistent burnout and consequently inefficient work due to inefficient processes. I find it quite interesting because it details a time where the company actually improves company infrastructure and processes for the engineers, rather than replacing the workers or hiring more in order to distribute more labor.

Cool Article Tanuj! I always thought Software Engineering was only about building complex applications for clients, but it's great to see that there are also internal projects that can help the employees of the company.
